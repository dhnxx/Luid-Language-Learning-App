Luid is a language learning application dedicated to preserving the endangered Kapampangan Language through the power of gamification and advanced algorithms. It leverages Leitner, Spaced-repetition, and SuperMemo algorithms to personalize the learning experience. Our goals include introducing gamification as an effective educational tool, testing the compatibility of these algorithms with Kapampangan, and actively contributing to the language's revival.
